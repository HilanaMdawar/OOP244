**Workshop 3 – Reflection**

In this workshop, I was able to design and implement a class that manages dynamic memory while maintaining a safe empty state. Working with the `CC` class helped me better understand encapsulation, particularly why data members should be private and only accessed through well-defined member functions. I also gained a clearer understanding of the roles of constructors and destructors in properly initializing and cleaning up resources.

Implementing the `aloCopy` and `deallocate` functions strengthened my understanding of dynamic memory allocation, deep copying, and why careful memory management is essential in C++. I learned how to centralize validation logic within a class to prevent invalid data from being stored. Writing the `validate` function allowed me to practice using logical conditions to enforce constraints on input data.

I also learned more about formatted output through the provided `display` function and how private helper methods can work together with public member functions to produce the correct output. This helped me see how class design supports both functionality and readability.

One of the main challenges I faced was correctly handling memory allocation and deallocation to avoid memory leaks or crashes. I also found it difficult to match the exact formatting of the expected output, which required careful attention to spacing and alignment.

Overall, this workshop improved my understanding of resource management and class design, both of which are fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming. In future workshops, I would appreciate more detailed examples on memory management and debugging techniques to further strengthen these skills.
