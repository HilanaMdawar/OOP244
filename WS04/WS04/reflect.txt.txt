I learned how to use member operator overloading in C++. In addition to this, I learned how to make a class act more natural through the use of added functionality with operators. I worked on the implementation of type conversion operator, binary operator, unary operator, and the subscript operator. This provided me with a better understanding of the interaction with operators and the use of returning *this to allow chaining of operations. I learned how to operationalize and manage different states of an object, like an account being valid, new, or invalid, and how operators can behave with respect to these states. A specific and important thing I learned was the degree of care that is needed in formatting to match an expected output. Even though the logic may be correct, the output may be considered incorrect because of differences, whether big or small, in spacing, width of a field, or alignment. Because of working with the display function, I learned about stream formatting using the function setters for width and precision along with alignment. I also gained a better understanding of const correctness and when member functions of an object should or should not modify that object.

The biggest challenge I faced was figuring out which formatting and alignment issues were causing the problems. I didn't know which operator or function was the culprit of the problem. I also thought prefix and postfix operators were a bit confusing at the beginning. However, in general, this workshop helped me become more confident with class design and operator overloading in C.
